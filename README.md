Laptop Price Prediction App
Overview
The Laptop Price Prediction App is a web application designed to help users estimate laptop prices based on various features. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to provide accurate price predictions, making it a valuable tool for potential buyers looking to understand the market better.

Features
User-Friendly Interface: The application is built using Streamlit, offering an intuitive interface where users can input laptop specifications.
Dynamic Feature Selection: Users can select various laptop features such as brand, CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage type, allowing for a tailored prediction experience.
Accurate Predictions: The application employs a sophisticated machine learning model built with a stacking ensemble method, combining multiple algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) to deliver precise price estimates.
Real-Time Feedback: Users receive immediate predictions based on their input, enhancing the overall experience.
Technical Details
Data Preprocessing: The app includes a robust preprocessing pipeline that handles categorical feature encoding and data transformations, ensuring high-quality input for the model.
Model Training: The model is trained using a pipeline consisting of a ColumnTransformer for feature transformation and a StackingRegressor for making predictions. The final model is a Ridge regression estimator that optimally combines the predictions of the base models.
Model Serialization: The trained model is saved using joblib, enabling efficient loading and saving of the model to ensure quick access during predictions.
